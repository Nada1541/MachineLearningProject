# MHEALTH Activity Recognition Using Machine Learning

## Introduction
The MHEALTH dataset contains sensor data to support research in activity recognition for mobile health applications. This project uses machine learning to classify physical activities, aiding healthcare and wellness monitoring.

## Project Overview
Steps include:
1. Data preparation: load data, visualize correlations, drop irrelevant columns, and split into training, testing, and validation sets.
2. Model training: KNN (K=5), SVM (C=80), Logistic Regression, Linear Regression, and a Neural Network with 64-32-12 architecture.
3. Evaluation: metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and MSE. Confusion matrices are generated for comparison.

## Conclusion
Neural Networks excel in handling complex patterns in high-dimensional data. This project demonstrates the importance of model selection and hyperparameter tuning in activity recognition tasks.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies
3. Run the project
